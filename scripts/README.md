```

### 2. Plan a Sprint
```bash
# Generate sprint plan with 40-hour capacity (default)
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py sprint

# Generate sprint plan with custom capacity
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py sprint --capacity 20
```

### 3. Update Issue Status
```bash
# Mark issue as in progress
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py update --issue-id 42 --status "In Progress" --assignee "developer-name"

# Mark issue as completed
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py update --issue-id 42 --status "Completed"
```

### 4. Generate Reports
```bash
# Save progress report to file
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py report --output progress_report.md

# Save sprint plan to file
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py sprint --output sprint_plan.md
```

## Usage Examples

### Daily Standup Reports
```bash
# Generate quick status for daily standup
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py list | grep "In Progress\|Ready for Review"
```

### Weekly Progress Review
```bash
# Generate comprehensive weekly report
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py report --output weekly_report_$(date +%Y%m%d).md
```

### Sprint Planning
```bash
# Plan next sprint based on team capacity
python3 scripts/issue_tracker.py sprint --capacity 32 --output sprint_$(date +%Y%m%d).md
```

## Integration with GitHub

### Using Issue Templates
When creating new issues on GitHub:

1. **Bug Reports**: Use the bug report template for systematic bug documentation
2. **Feature Requests**: Use the feature request template for new functionality
3. **Security Issues**: Use the security template for vulnerabilities (consider private reporting)

### Automated Workflows
The system is designed to integrate with GitHub Actions for:

- Automatic issue labeling and assignment
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Sprint milestone management
- Notification systems

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Velocity**: Issues completed per sprint
- **Quality**: Defect escape rate and regression count  
- **Efficiency**: Average time to resolution by priority
- **Coverage**: Percentage of total effort completed

### Success Metrics

- **Sprint 1 Success**: All critical security issues resolved
- **Sprint 2 Success**: Major bug fixes and configuration issues resolved
- **Sprint 3 Success**: Code quality improved, no remaining cleanup items
- **Sprint 4 Success**: Architectural improvements in place

## Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Update issue status in tracking system
- Generate progress reports
- Review and adjust sprint plans
- Identify new issues from code reviews

### Monthly Tasks  
- Review overall project health
- Update issue priorities based on business needs
- Analyze velocity and quality metrics
- Plan longer-term architectural work

## Best Practices

### Issue Management
1. **Triage New Issues**: Assign priority and component within 24 hours
2. **Regular Updates**: Update status at least twice per week
3. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Define success criteria before starting work
4. **Test Coverage**: Ensure adequate testing for all fixes

### Communication
1. **Daily Standups**: Share progress and blockers
2. **Weekly Reviews**: Assess sprint progress and adjust plans
3. **Documentation**: Keep technical decisions documented
4. **Escalation**: Raise blockers and dependencies quickly

### Quality Assurance
1. **Code Reviews**: All changes require peer review
2. **Testing**: Automated and manual testing before merging
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for critical functionality
4. **Rollback Plans**: Have rollback procedures for production changes
